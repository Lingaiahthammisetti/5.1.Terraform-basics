\# Terraform concepts:



EC2 instance creation: Used to launch and manage EC2 instances through code.



Variables: Help make Terraform code reusable and configurable.



Conditions: Allow different behavior based on environments like dev or prod.



Count: Creates multiple identical resources easily.



Expense project: Uses tags to track and control infrastructure costs.



Locals: Store common values to avoid repetition.



Data source: Fetches details of existing AWS resources.



Remote state: Stores Terraform state centrally for team collaboration.



for\_each: Creates multiple resources when each one is unique.



Dynamic block: Generates blocks dynamically based on input values.









\#What are difference between roles: DevOps Engineer, SRE, Cloud Engineers, Platform Engineers?#

DevOps engineers automate workflows, code infrastructure, and ensure smooth deployments(Tools: Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes).

SRE automates software installation and system management using tools like Python for scripting and Prometheus for monitoring and alerting.(Tools: Python, Prometheus)

Cloud engineers design and manage cloud infrastructure, including provisioning, scaling, and optimizing resources.(Tools: AWS, Azure Terraform)

Platform engineers build and maintain application platforms, ensuring they are reliable, scalable, and efficient for development and deployment.(Tools: GitLab CI, Docker, Kubernetes)

Cloud engineers manage cloud infrastructure, while platform engineers build and maintain application platforms.
